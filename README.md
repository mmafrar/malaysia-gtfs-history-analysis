## 📘 Overview

This repository contains scripts and resources developed as part of an assignment for the *Master of Software Engineering* program at **Universiti Malaya**. The project focuses on analyzing historical GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data for Malaysia.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to consolidate and analyze GTFS data from multiple subdirectories within the [Malaysia GTFS History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kwongtn/malaysia-gtfs-history/data) dataset on Kaggle. This enables more effective exploration and visualization of public transportation trends over time.

## 🛠️ Script

The primary script used to merge and process the GTFS files is available on Kaggle:

🔗 [Case Study 0 - Merging GTFS Files and Feeds](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmafrar/case-study-0-merging-gtfs-files-and-feeds)

This notebook demonstrates how to:
- Read and parse GTFS data from multiple feeds
- Merge relevant files across different time periods
- Prepare the data for further analysis

## 📦 Dataset

You can download the processed dataset from the [Releases](https://github.com/mmafrar/malaysia-gtfs-history-analysis/releases) section of this repository.
